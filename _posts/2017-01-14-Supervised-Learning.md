As i mentioned in my previous blog, There are two ways in which machine learns. One supervised and another un-supervised way.

As it is clear by name,supervised learning is a type in which machine has got some data (generally reffered as training data in machine learning context) based on which it gives you a result or predict the outcome. In short if i have to say then, Learning is done based on past/actual data and outcome is predicted/derived.

For example, i have an agrigulture farm and i have past data which says Y ton of paddy cultivated on X sq.ft land like shown below

**Example 1**

Land(in Sq.ft)|Paddy(in tons)
--------------|---------------
2000|0.5
20050|12
1600|0.3


Here in this example we have training data as in the table and the prediction becomes better and better when we have more data to supervise. Assume that we ask machine to  tell me what will be the production of paddy if i have land of 2500 sq.ft.

Now there are many ways to solve this problem,We choose a perfect model to solve this problem which depends on the training data present. May be in the above case we will use regression model.

Again supervised learning is divided into two

1. Regression
2. Classification

The above example is type of regression supervised learning. Let's assume another example where we are given with the set of weather data and we are asked to predict whether it will rain today or Not. This is called classification supervised learning. 

Assume in example one itself if i ask machine to tell that, whether will i get paddy above 2 ton or lower than 2 ton for 2500 sq.ft. then it will be classification model.
