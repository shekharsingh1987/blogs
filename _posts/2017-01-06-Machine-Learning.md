title: Machine Learning
---
Today we are in era where we are looking forward to write less code as possible and computer(machines) change the behaviour over period by themselves through their experience. We are in era where we are trying to replicate ourselves, we are trying to make a system which doesn't need instruction all the time, instead take decision by themselves. it's possible only if you learn constantly and understand. So machine learning is the next thing that humans are working towards. tomorrow this can be used on robotics, sensors and our personal assitance.

For example we get the mail amd machine automatically identifies whether its spam or real content. It evolves over the period and learns based on your activities. So the performace(P) of any action(T) is proportional to the experience(E). Thus more the training data more accurate the result. Hence mathematically we represent machine learning like below.

 ```
                                    P = E + T
                                      where p improves as per experience.
 ```


Theoretically there are two ways in which machine learns:
 1. Supervised learning
 2. Un-Supervised learning
 
 I will explain these two type of learning mechanism in my upcoming blogs. Please mail me `shekharsingh_1987@yahoo.com` to join the conversation.
