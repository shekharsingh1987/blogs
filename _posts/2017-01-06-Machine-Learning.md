title: Machine Learning
---
Today we are in era where we are looking forward to write less code as possible and computer(machines) change the behaviour over period by themselfs. We are in era where we are trying to replicate ourselves, we are trying to make a system which doesn't need instruction all the time, instead take decision by themselves. it's possible only if you learn constantly and understand. So machine learning is the next thing that humans are working towards. tomorrow this can be used on robotics, sensors and our personal assitance.
