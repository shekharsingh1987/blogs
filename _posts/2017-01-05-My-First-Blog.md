title: My First Blog
---
First let me thank github for a free space.I have created this page on github using jekyll. This is my first blog on this blog site, but i am not writing blog first time. I have a blog called <a href="http://sqlpanda.blogspot.in/">SQl panda </a> which is all about sql and no-sql related. So thought of starting a generic blog where i can choose to write anything i learn and widen my range of technology.

Well in short about me, i am shekhar kumar. I hail from Patna,Bihar. I am an engineering graduate in electronics and communication branch. during my college time i was well known for circuit designing and debugging. Then i joined a software firm where i worked on various domain, then i found that i love designing and architecting. I am taking my career towards solution architect beyond any technology. I have soft corner towards embedded world which is well known these days by IOT(Internet of things).

As hobby i play guitar and i spend free time on bike trips, listening music, learn new things and share with world.
